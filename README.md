# Basic Python Tasks - Module 2

This repository contains two Python programs created as part of **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

**Objective:**  
This program performs basic arithmetic operations between two numbers entered by the user.

### âœ” Functionality:
- Takes two integer inputs from the user.
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Prints the result of each operation.

**Note:**  
Division is performed without error handling, so users should avoid entering 0 as the second number to prevent runtime errors.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Personalized Greeting

**Objective:**  
This program creates a greeting message using the userâ€™s full name.

### âœ” Functionality:
- Takes the user's first and last name as input.
- Concatenates them into a full name.
- Prints a personalized greeting message using `f-string`.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**Objective:**  
This program checks whether a given number is even or odd using an `if-else` condition.

### âœ” Functionality:
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Uses an `if-else` statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
- Prints the result.

### ðŸ§ª Sample Output:
Enter a number: 6

6 is a even number 


Enter a number 7

7 is a odd number

## ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**Objective:**  
This program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

### âœ” Functionality:
- Iterates from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
- Adds all numbers in the range.
- Prints the final sum.

### ðŸ§ª Sample Output:

The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
